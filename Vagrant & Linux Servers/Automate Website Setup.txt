Automate the provisioning of a website using Vagrant and infrastructure as code (IAC) principles. The focus is on creating a Vagrantfile that includes provisioning commands for setting up a finance website. Here's a summary:

Open Project in Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

Open VS Code and navigate to the Vagrant VMs folder.
Copy the existing finance VM folder and rename it to "IAC" (Infrastructure as Code).

Edit the Vagrantfile:

Open the Vagrantfile in the "IAC" folder.
Change the IP address to avoid collisions (e.g., 192.168.1.28).
Uncomment the provisioning section.

Write Provisioning Commands:

Write provisioning commands to set up the website automatically.
Commands include installing dependencies (Httpd, Wget, Unzip, Vim), starting and enabling Httpd service, creating a temporary folder, downloading and extracting website data, copying data to the document root, restarting the service, and cleaning up temporary files.
Emphasis on knowing the commands from previous manual setup and verifying each step.

Test the Automation:

Save the Vagrantfile.
Open Git Bash and navigate to the "IAC" folder.
Run vagrant up to start the VM and execute the provisioning commands.
Verify the website by accessing its IP address in the browser.

Reusability and Infrastructure as Code:

Discuss the concept of infrastructure as code (IAC).
Highlight the ability to reuse code for provisioning websites.
Emphasize the advantage of having scripts for setting up websites anytime, anywhere.

Cleanup:

After testing, run vagrant destroy to remove the VM.
Conclusion:

The demonstration showcases the automation of website setup using Vagrant and IAC principles.
The resulting Vagrantfile with provisioning commands serves as a reusable script for future setups.
