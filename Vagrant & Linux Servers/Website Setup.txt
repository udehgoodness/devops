Server management in Linux, specifically demonstrating how to set up the Httpd service on CentOS and deploy a basic HTML template. Key points include:

Introduction to Server Management:

Overview of the objectives, which involve installing and managing a server or service on a Linux operating system.

Hands-On Practice - CentOS Httpd Setup:

Use the Brave browser to navigate to the toplate.com website, which offers ready-made templates for websites.
Select a template (e.g., finance) and download the zip file. The instructor recommends using the Brave browser to avoid unnecessary pop-ups.
Create a new folder for the project in the F drive (e.g., Vagrant VMs/finance).
Initialize a new Vagrant project using the Euro Linux CentOS box.
Edit the Vagrantfile to set a static IP (e.g., 192.168.56.22) and allocate 1GB of RAM.
Install dependencies (wget, vim, unzip, zip) on the CentOS VM.
Start and enable the Httpd service on CentOS.
Create an index.html file in the /var/www/html directory to display a basic message.
Access the default Httpd web page from the browser using the assigned IP.

Downloading and Deploying HTML Template:

Explore the toplate.com website and select a template for download.
Use the Brave browser's Developer Tools (F12) to find the download link for the template zip file.
Download the zip file using the wget command in the VM's /tmp directory.
Unzip the downloaded file and copy its contents (including index.html) to the /var/www/html directory.
Restart the Httpd service to apply the changes.

Validation and Firewall Considerations:

Validate the status of the Httpd service using systemctl status httpd.
Check the firewall status (systemctl status firewalld) and, if active, stop and disable it. Note that this step may vary depending on the host operating system.

Final Browser Validation:

Verify the website's deployment by refreshing the browser, ensuring that the HTML template is successfully displayed.

Overview of Server Deployment Steps:

Recap of the server deployment steps, including creating the VM, installing dependencies, configuring services, and deploying data.

Cleanup and Preparation for the Next Lecture:

Exit from the VM, power it off, and consider deleting or destroying the VM to clean up resources.
