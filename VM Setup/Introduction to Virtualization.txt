Evolution to Virtualization:

Recognized the cost challenges of setting up labs with 5, 10, or 15 computers.
Learned about virtualization as a solution to efficiently run multiple operating systems on a single machine.
Acknowledged the ease of creating virtual machines (VMs) through virtualization software.

Introduction to Virtualization Concepts:

Discovered that virtualization allows one computer to perform the functions of multiple computers simultaneously.
Understood the historical reliance on physical servers for running services and applications.
Realized the challenges of isolation and over-provisioning in the traditional approach.

Role of VMware in Virtualization:

Explored the transformative impact of VMware in introducing virtualization.
Embraced the concept of running multiple operating systems on a single computer, enhancing isolation.

Terminology and Virtualization Components:

Familiarized with key terms such as host OS, guest OS (VM), snapshot, and hypervisor.
Differentiated between type 1 (bare metal) and type 2 (hosted) hypervisors.
Recognized that virtualization allows for the partitioning of physical resources into virtual resources.

Lab Setup and Automation:

Prepared for creating virtual machines using Oracle VM VirtualBox and Vagrant.
Understood the importance of automation but emphasized the prerequisite of manual understanding.
Recognized the need for a 64-bit computer with a high-speed internet connection for optimal performance.

Manual VM Creation:

Learned the manual process of VM creation, involving Oracle VM VirtualBox and ISO files for CentOS and Ubuntu.
Emphasized the significance of knowing manual steps before proceeding to automation.

Automated VM Creation with Vagrant:

Prepared for automated VM creation using Vagrant, VirtualBox, and specific tools.
Recognized Vagrant as a tool to simplify and expedite the VM creation process.

Lab Requirements:

Acknowledged the tools required for both manual and automated setups, including Oracle VM VirtualBox, ISO files, and Vagrant.

Course Direction:

Anticipated the importance of these lab exercises for practicing Linux and upcoming tools in the DevOps course.
Prepared for a shift to cloud computing, with initial emphasis on Linux VMs for foundational practice.
