The classification of networks are based on geography or the distance between network interfaces. Here are the main points covered:

Local Area Network (LAN): Devices are in close proximity, typically within a room or a small area. Computers are connected using switches.

Wide Area Network (WAN): Network interfaces can be far apart, such as accessing a website hosted in a different geographical location. The Internet is a significant example of a WAN.

Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): Larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, covering a metropolitan city's municipality or specific areas within a city.

Campus Area Network (CAN): Networks within a campus, like an office or college campus. Computers are connected within a limited area.

Personal Area Network (PAN): A personal network, like a Bluetooth or hotspot connection with a very small range.

Networking devices:

Switch: Connects multiple computers within a local area network. Enables communication between devices in the same network.

Router: Connects multiple networks, allowing communication between devices in different networks. Essential for connecting local networks to the Internet.

Understanding home networks. In a typical home network:

A Wi-Fi router connects devices within the home.
Switches within the router facilitate communication between devices in the same network.
The router connects to the modem, establishing a connection to the Internet.
The concepts are extended to larger corporate networks or data centers, where multiple switches, routers, and additional security devices like firewalls are used for high availability and security.

Next, IP addresses:

IPv4 Address: A 32-bit binary number represented in decimal format. Divided into four octets, each ranging from 0 to 255.

Example: 192.168.100.1

IP addresses are classified into public and private ranges:

Public IP: Assigned by ISPs and used on the Internet.

Private IP: Used within private networks. Ranges include Class A (10.x.x.x), Class B (172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x), and Class C (192.168.x.x).

Finally, Emphasizes the importance of understanding IP addresses and network configurations for setting up AWS VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud) in the future sessions.
