Introduction to sudo:

sudo allows normal users to execute commands with root privileges.
Demonstrated examples of using sudo -i to switch to the root user and execute root commands.

Understanding sudo Privileges:

Highlighted that by default, only the vagrant user has sudo privileges.
Showed examples of root commands executed with sudo.

Granting sudo Privileges:

Explained how to grant sudo privileges to other users by adding them to the sudoers file.
Emphasized that sudo acts as a power of attorney on behalf of the root user.

Testing sudo for Non-privileged User:

Logged in as the ansible user and attempted to execute root commands using sudo.
Encountered an error indicating that ansible is not in the sudoers file.

Editing the sudoers File:

Set a password for the ansible user using passwd ansible.
Opened the sudoers file using visudo.
Copied the root user line and added a new line for the ansible user.
Showed that ansible could then execute sudo -i.

Making sudo Non-interactive:

Demonstrated how to make sudo non-interactive by adding NOPASSWD to the sudoers file.
Used visudo again and added ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL.
Showed that ansible could then execute sudo commands without entering its password.

Using sudoers.d Directory:

Discussed a safer method of managing sudo privileges by using the /etc/sudoers.d/ directory.
Created a new file /etc/sudoers.d/devops and added devops ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL to it.

Safety Considerations:

Discouraged direct editing of the /etc/sudoers file due to the risk of syntax errors.
Advocated for using /etc/sudoers.d/ and creating individual files for better organization.

Additional Notes:

Mentioned that syntax errors in the sudoers file can render sudo non-functional.
Showed that if syntax errors occur, visudo provides an option to fix them before saving.

Practice and Recap:

Encouraged users to practice and gain a thorough understanding of sudo and sudoers.
Highlighted the importance of the sudo command in allowing non-root users to perform administrative tasks.

Software management in Linux, focusing on RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) and YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified). Here are the key points:

Introduction to Software Management:

Highlighted the importance of software or package management in Linux.
Emphasized the diversity in methods of installing or setting up software.

Manual Installation with RPM:

Demonstrated a manual way of setting up a package using the tree command as an example.
Searched for the tree RPM online, downloaded it using curl, and installed it with rpm -i.

Understanding RPM Commands:

Explained various options for the rpm command, such as -e for erasing, -q for querying, and others.
Showcased commands like rpm -qa to list all installed RPMs and rpm -e to remove an installed package.

Introduction to YUM:

Introduced YUM as a package manager that automates the process of package installation and management.
Discussed the repository configuration files located in /etc/yum.repos.d/.

Using YUM for Package Installation:

Demonstrated how to search for a package using yum search.
Installed the httpd package using yum install httpd and observed that it automatically handled dependencies.

Installing Jenkins with YUM:

Searched for Jenkins installation instructions on the official website.
Used yum install wget to install the wget utility.
Followed the provided commands to configure the Jenkins repository and install Jenkins.

Managing Software with YUM Commands:

Showed common YUM commands like yum upgrade to update all packages and yum remove to uninstall a package.
Explained the importance of updating packages for security and performance.

Additional YUM Commands:

Mentioned other YUM commands such as yum reinstall, yum group list, yum repolist, yum clean all, yum history, and yum info.

services in a Linux system and demonstrated the management of services using systemctl. Here are the key points:

Introduction to Services:

Mentioned the concept of services running on a Linux system.
Focused on the httpd service, which is a web service.

Managing Services with systemctl:

Demonstrated how to install the httpd package using yum install httpd.
Checked the status of the httpd service using systemctl status httpd.
Started the httpd service with systemctl start httpd.
Checked the status again to confirm that it's active.
Explained the concept of starting, stopping, and restarting services.

Service Persistence:

Discussed the issue of services not automatically starting after a system reboot.
Used systemctl enable httpd to enable the httpd service to start at boot time.

Checking Service Status:

Introduced additional systemctl commands for checking service status.
Used systemctl is-active httpd to check if the service is currently active.
Used systemctl is-enabled httpd to check if the service is enabled for boot time.

Understanding systemctl Configuration:

Explained the configuration file for the httpd service located at /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service.
Showed the content of the configuration file, which specifies the binary and its arguments to start and stop the service.

Service Management Recap:

Summarized the key systemctl commands used for service management.

Linux system, introducing commands like top, ps aux, ps -ef, and demonstrated how to manage processes using kill. Here are the key points:

Processes Overview:

Processes in a Linux system can be in a running or sleeping state.
Used the top command, which is similar to a task manager in Windows, to view dynamic processes based on CPU and RAM consumption.
Discussed various information displayed by the top command, including uptime, load average, total tasks, CPU and RAM utilization.

Process Management Commands:

Introduced various commands to manage processes.
Used ps aux to display detailed information about processes, including process ID (PID), user, CPU and RAM utilization, status, and process name.
Demonstrated ps -ef to show processes with additional information such as the parent process ID (PPID).

Parent and Child Processes:

Discussed parent and child processes and how processes are initiated (forked) by other processes.
Illustrated the hierarchy of processes, where a parent process starts child processes.

Process Termination:

Introduced the kill command for terminating processes.
Demonstrated how to use kill with the parent process ID to stop a process.
Explored the option -9 for a forceful termination, which may result in orphan processes.

Handling Orphan Processes:

Explained orphan processes as those whose parent process has terminated.
Demonstrated how systemd adopts orphan processes.
Showed how to forcefully terminate orphan processes using a combination of commands (ps, awk, xargs, kill).

Handling Zombie Processes:

Defined zombie processes as dead processes with an entry still in the process table.
Recommended rebooting the machine as the best way to clear zombie processes.
Introduced the ps aux command to identify zombie processes and discussed potential issues.

Process Filtering and Batch Termination:

Demonstrated how to filter processes and selectively terminate them using awk and xargs.
Showed a command to find and kill processes at once by
