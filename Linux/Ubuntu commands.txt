Basics of using Ubuntu operating system, highlighting some key differences between Ubuntu and CentOS. Here are the main points covered:

User Management:

Ubuntu uses the adduser command instead of useradd to create new users. This command creates a user, group, home directory, and copies files from /etc/skel to the user's home directory.

bash
Copy code
adduser devops
Sudo Configuration:

In Ubuntu, the default editor for sudo configuration is nano. If you prefer to use vim, you can set it as the default editor temporarily using the export command:

bash
Copy code
export EDITOR=vim
To make this change permanent, further configuration can be done (details not covered in this segment).

Package Management:

Ubuntu uses apt for package management instead of yum used in CentOS.

The command apt update refreshes the package lists, and apt upgrade upgrades all the installed packages.

bash
Copy code
apt update
apt upgrade
To search for packages, apt search can be used, and to install a package, apt install.

bash
Copy code
apt search tree
apt install tree
Package removal can be done using apt remove or apt purge. The purge option removes the package along with its configuration files.

bash
Copy code
apt remove apache2
apt purge apache2
Service Management:

Ubuntu uses systemctl for service management similar to CentOS. Services can be enabled, started, stopped, or restarted using systemctl.

bash
Copy code
systemctl enable apache2
systemctl start apache2
systemctl stop apache2
systemctl restart apache2
Firewall Configuration:

Ubuntu uses ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) for managing the firewall. When installing or uninstalling services like Apache2, ufw is automatically updated.
Other Notes:

The command dpkg -l lists all installed Debian packages.
