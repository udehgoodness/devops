Setting up MySQL, Memcache, and RabbitMQ services as part of the VProfile project. The goal is to establish the backend services in the following order: MySQL, Memcache, RabbitMQ, Tomcat, and Nginx.

MySQL Setup:

Switch to the root user on the virtual machine.
Run the command yum update to update the packages to the latest versions.
Install the necessary packages: yum install -y mariadb-server git.
Start and enable the MariaDB service: systemctl start mariadb and systemctl enable mariadb.
Run the command mysql_secure_installation to set up and secure the MySQL installation. This involves setting the root password, removing anonymous users, disallowing remote root login, and more.

Database Setup:

Log in to MySQL: mysql -u root -p.
Create a database named "accounts": CREATE DATABASE accounts;.
Grant privileges to a user named "admin" with the password "admin123" to access the database remotely: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON accounts.* TO 'admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin123';.
Flush privileges: FLUSH PRIVILEGES;.
Exit the MySQL prompt: exit.

Database Deployment:

Clone the source code: cd /path/to/repository.
Run SQL queries from the DB_backup.sql file to set up the necessary tables and data in the "accounts" database: mysql -u admin -p accounts < src/main/resources/DB_backup.sql.

Memcache Setup:

Switch to the root user.
Install Memcached: dnf install -y memcached.
Start and enable the Memcached service: systemctl start memcached and systemctl enable memcached.
Edit the Memcached configuration file to allow remote connections: sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/' /etc/sysconfig/memcached.
Restart the Memcached service: systemctl restart memcached.

RabbitMQ Setup:

Switch to the root user.
Update the OS: yum update -y.
Enable the RabbitMQ repository: curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/script.rpm.sh | bash.
Install RabbitMQ: yum install -y rabbitmq-server.
Start and enable the RabbitMQ service: systemctl start rabbitmq-server and systemctl enable rabbitmq-server.
Create a configuration file for RabbitMQ: echo "NODENAME=rabbit@localhost" > /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf.
Add a user "test" with the password "test" and set it as an administrator: rabbitmqctl add_user test test && rabbitmqctl set_user_tags test administrator.
Restart the RabbitMQ service: systemctl restart rabbitmq-server.
Check the status of RabbitMQ: systemctl status rabbitmq-server.
